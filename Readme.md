# Real-Time Object Detection for Blind Individuals

## Introduction
This project aims to provide a solution for visually impaired individuals to better understand their surroundings through real-time object detection and depth estimation. By utilizing computer vision techniques, we generate auditory cues corresponding to detected objects, enabling blind users to navigate and comprehend their environment more effectively.

## Features
- Real-time object detection: The system detects objects in the environment in real-time using computer vision algorithms.
- Depth estimation: Depth information is estimated to provide spatial context to the detected objects.
- Auditory feedback: Detected objects are translated into auditory cues, providing a non-visual understanding of the environment.
